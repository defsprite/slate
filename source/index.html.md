# Introduction

Welcome to the ReleseBits API! 

The purpose of this API is to easily consume events that occur in any [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) 
and [Delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) process in order to pass them on to various external 
APIs: 

  - Grafana
  - Sentry
  - Bugsnag
  - Newrelic
  - Custom Webhooks

It is also planned to soon provide endpoints for Prometheus metrics or build badges based on these events.

# Terminology 

Most software applications will be built from one or more **components** - a monolithic app usually has only very few, whereas in a microservice approach 
there are a lot of individual ones. 

The sucessful creation of a new **version** of given a component is called a **build**. Builds can have errors for 
various reasons thus not creating new versions of the component.

Putting a different version of a component onto a live system is called a **deployment**. Any group of at least one deployment forms a **release**, 
which should enclose a set of meaningful changes for human stakeholders to the software.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# Passing via Authorization header with each request
curl -H "Authorization: some-api-token" \
     "https://api.releasebits.com/"

# Passing via request parameter with each request
curl "https://api.releasebits.com/?access_token=some-api-token"
```

```shell_session
$ curl "https://api.releasebits.com/?access_token=some-api-token"
```

> Make sure to replace `some-api-token` with your API key.

ReleaseBits uses API tokens to allow access to the API. You can register a new API token [here](/account/tokens).

ReleaseBits expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer some-api-token`

For scripting convenience, you can alternatively specify the token as the `access_token` URL parameter:

`https://api.releasebits.com/?access_token=some-api-token`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>some-api-token</code> with your API token.
</aside>


# Deployments

Denotes that a new version of a given component is has been put onto a live system. This should be recorded individually
for all hosts and stages in order to have good resolution for metrics systems.

We highly recommend setting at least `finished_at` from local system time, in order to keep timestamps in sync with your 
logging systems

## Creating A New Deployment

The only required field to create a new deployment event is the `version` field. However, it is a good idea to submit
as much data as possible in oder to get the most of your 3rd party tooling. 

```shell
curl -XPOST "https://api.releasebits.com/components/component-slug/deployments/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer some-api-token" \
  -d ' {
        "version": "v1.2.3",
        "result": "success",
        "stage": "staging",
        "host": "host.example.com",
        "code_name": "Funky F端nke",
        "started_at": "2018-05-27T13:15:30.311Z",
        "finished_at": "2018-05-27T13:15:31.191Z",
        "meta_data": {
          "user_id": "metauser",
          "foo": "bar"
        },
        "commit_sha": "b927e3797fc56fb8bc093d59ee7a624dafddadd2",
        "tag": "tag1.2.3",
        "branch": "release" 
     } '
```

```shell_session
$ curl -XPOST "https://api.releasebits.com/components/component-slug/deployments?access_token=some-api-token&version=v1.2.3&result=success&stage=staging&host=host.example.com&code_name=Funky%20F%C3%BCnke&started_at=2018-05-27T13%3A15%3A30.311Z&finished_at=2018-05-27T13%3A15%3A31.191Z&meta_data[user_id]=metauser&meta_data[foo]=bar&commit_sha=b927e3797fc56fb8bc093d59ee7a624dafddadd2&tag=tag1.2.3&branch=release"
```

> On success the above command returns JSON structured like this along with `201` status:

```json
  { 
    "id": "44b6a0d3-b7a0-4f26-b976-5fce52bfc4b9"
  }
```
